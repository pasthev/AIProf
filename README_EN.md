## How to Use A.I. Prof

Using **A.I. Prof** is simple and intuitive:

1.  **Select the Interface Language:** Choose your preferred language from the sidebar dropdown menu.
2.  **Choose a Language Model:** Select the Gemini model you want to use (Gemini Pro or Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp.) in the sidebar.
3.  **Gemini API Key:**
    *   If you do not enter a user API key or do not already have one defined in your system, the application will use a default API key (likely to become saturated if too many simultaneous requests are made).
    *   To overcome this problem, you can provide your personal API key in the field provided for this purpose in the sidebar. This key will be stored temporarily for the duration of your session. "‚úî" and "‚ùå" buttons are available to validate or cancel your user API key.
    *   For more flexibility, you can save your personal Gemini API key in your `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.
    *   You can easily and freely obtain your own Gemini API key on the [Google AI Studio website](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). If you want to save this key on your system so you don't have to enter it each time, this [AI Studio help page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) explains how to do it.
4.  **Set up your Request:**
    *   **Student Age:** Select the approximate age of your students using the dropdown menu.
    *   **Number of Students:** Adjust the slider to indicate the number of students involved.
    *   **Subject Mode:** Choose between "Specific Topics", "School Disciplines" or "Free Mode" via the radio buttons.
    *   **Learning Topic:**
        *   **Specific Topics/School Disciplines:** Select a topic from the proposed dropdown list (the list varies depending on the mode and age). You can use the "üé≤" button to get a random topic suggestion.
        *   **Free Mode:** Enter the topic of your choice directly in the free text field.
    *   **Special Instructions (optional):** If you wish, enter specific instructions to refine the content generation (for example, "Make the text concise", "Use a formal tone", etc.).
5.  **Generate Content:** Click on one of the available action buttons (Lesson, Exercises, Practical Work, Revision, Homework, Quiz, Memo) to generate the desired type of educational content.

    **Good to know**: If you start by generating a lesson on a topic of your choice, the Exercises, Workshops, Revision, Homework, and Quiz buttons will generate content directly related to this lesson, provided it was created with the same age and number of students parameters, **A.I. Prof** automatically searching the history for the last lesson generated with the same parameters. If no lesson has been previously generated, these buttons will generate random exercises in the chosen subject.
6.  **Consult the Response:** The response generated by the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwill be displayed below the buttons.
7.  **Navigate History (if applicable):** If you have generated multiple content items, you can navigate through the response history using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons. You can also lock/unlock the display of history via the "üîí/üîì" button.

**Important:**

*   **Warning about Inaccuracies:** The responses generated by the AI ‚Äã‚Äãmay sometimes contain inaccuracies. It is important to always verify and adapt the generated content before using it in a teaching context.
